# Computer Science Networking

## Overview
This repository contains self-written Computer Science networking programs created to understand how computer networks work. The focus is on learning networking concepts through simple code examples rather than advanced libraries.

## Objectives
- Understand how devices communicate in a network
- Learn basic networking models such as client–server
- Explore IP addressing and data transmission
- Connect theoretical networking concepts with practical code

## Topics Covered
- Client–Server communication
- Network topologies (logical simulation)
- IP addressing
- Data transmission basics
- Networking fundamentals for school-level Computer Science

## Languages Used
- Python (or write the language later)

## Purpose
This repository is created for educational and school project use.
